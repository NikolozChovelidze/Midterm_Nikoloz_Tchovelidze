Step 2: Initialize Git (if not done already)

    Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + `` or go to View > Terminal`).

    Run this command to initialize Git:

    bash

    git init

Step 3: Configure Git Username and Email (if not set up yet)

    Set your name (replace Your Name with your actual name):

    bash

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Set your email (replace with your GitHub email):

bash

    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Step 4: Add the GitHub Repository as Remote

    Go to GitHub and create a new repository (without adding a README or .gitignore).

    Copy the repository URL, which looks like https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git.

    Add this repository as a remote by running:

    bash

    git remote add origin <repository-url>

    Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL.

Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Project Files

    Add all files to staging:

    bash

git add .

Commit your files with a message:

bash

    git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 6: Push to GitHub

    Push your local repository to the GitHub repository:

    bash

    git push -u origin main

    (If your branch is named master instead of main, replace main with master.)

Verification

    Go to your GitHub repository page and refresh. You should see your project files uploaded.

These steps will connect your project to GitHub, commit the files, and push them to your repository.
